ps - periodic selection
==

### 1.1 The main question of this project: What is the probability of fixation of an allele under selection every P generations?

While there are many papers addressing randomly varying selection coefficients, all have assumed selection occuring every single generation. I argue that the dynamic of periodic selection can be quite different because the only force between periods is drift. Intuitively, if P is large then selection plays a neglible role in the dynamics of the allele.

### 1.2 Why is this interesting?
An interesting macro-evolutionary trend arises from the above intiution: longer lived organisms are more robust to periodic selection events than shorter lived organisms.

Suppose every 30 years a heatwave afflicts a region. Parrots - who have a long lifespan - see this event every generation. While, say, mice who have a lifespan of one year experience selection every 30 generations. Therefore for 29 generations, the only force affecting the dynamics of the allele conferring resistance to the heatwave is drift - resulting in a lower probability of fixation. 

Can this explain why rats cannot adapt to the flowering of bamboo: http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/nature/rat-attack.html ?
